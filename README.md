## Problem Statement 
WhatsApp is the most popular messaging across the world with more than a billion
active users. - https://www.whatsapp.com/. It is available as a mobile application and as
well as a web application at https://web.whatsapp.com/
Using Bootstrap skills that you have learnt in this level, you are required to create a
fully responsive design of WhatsApp . You are supposed to get the basic layout idea
from the mobile application and the web application. You are free to change the
theme colors, icons, message features etc.

You submission should have following pages -
  1) A main page displaying all the chat messages.
  2) A chat view page containing messages with an individual or a group
  3) A view to change the profile picture.
  4) Another main page view which displays all the chat messages but contains some
  unread messages from some people.
  You have to create this website and then push it to a github repository and then
  host it using Github pages.

## Important Points -
  1) The webpage you develop should be fully responsive, taking care of all screen
  sizes.
  2) The font and images and other content on the page should adhere to responsive
  design practices
  3) You will be given extra marks for creativity. So, feel free to use colors, text,
  images etc according to your best judgement.
  4) You are allowed to take ideas from external sources but do not use any of their
  code. You will lose marks for that
